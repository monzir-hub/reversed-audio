Description
This script is designed to analyze and manipulate WAV audio files using Python. It provides functionality to read audio properties, calculate file size, determine recording type, and reverse the audio data.

Requirements
Python 3.x
numpy library
scipy library
Usage
Installation:

Ensure Python is installed. If not, download and install it from python.org.
Install required libraries:
Copy code
pip install numpy scipy
Running the Script:

Place your WAV file (test.wav) in the same directory as the script.
Execute the script:
Copy code
python audio_analysis.py
The script will output the following information:
Length of the audio file in seconds.
Size of the audio data in bytes.
Audio format details (PCM encoding, sampling rate, bits per sample, type of recording).
Information about the reversed audio file.
Output:

The reversed audio (reversed_test.wav) will be saved in the same directory.
Notes
Ensure the input WAV file (test.wav) exists in the script's directory before running.
The script assumes standard PCM encoded WAV files. Adjustments may be needed for non-standard formats.
